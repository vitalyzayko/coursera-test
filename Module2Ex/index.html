			<p>Yes, the treadmill is fun and so are those dumbbells, but it can be easy to get stuck in a workout rut. If you're looking for a total-body routine that burns a ton of calories (and doesn't involve having to brave the frigid cold in any way), give swimming a try. From toning your core to speeding up your metabolism, here are eight reasons why it'll be your new go-to form of exercise—all year long.</p>

			<p class="running">I like running</p>
			<p>If you’ve been working out regularly, you’ve already discovered it: No matter how good or bad you feel at any given moment, exercise will make you feel better. And it goes beyond just the “runner’s high”—that rush of feel-good hormones known as endocannabinoids. In a study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, researchers found that even a single bout of exercise—30 minutes of walking on a treadmill—could instantly lift the mood of someone suffering from a major depressive order. </p>

			<p class="climbing">I like wall climbing</p>
			<p> Rock climbing is a difficult sport. You’re required to use your strength to cling to the wall and often times you are holding most of your muscles in a static hold, constantly tensed. You should aim to be as relaxed as possible to get better at climbing, but sometimes you can’t and it’s very hard work. This is a good thing.</p>
